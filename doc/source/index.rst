Welcome to docvis's documentation!
==================================

Docvis enables Python3 programs to produce standalone HTML documents with interactive plot elements.

It is largely based on `Bokeh <https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ but can interoperate with 
many different plotting "backends".

Docvis was built to enable **end-users** define output via Markdown **both** for text **and** diagrams.

Just as you can determine a piece of text to render as ``**strong**``, using the Markdown emphasis convention,
you can also fully determine a line plot to have different dimensions, line thickness, different data source and so on...

...all via markup.
